# PowerAI Vision Apps

This repository is home to a number of PowerAI Vision applications. Each of them wrap a front end around a different custom model deployed via [PowerAI Vision](https://developer.ibm.com/linuxonpower/deep-learning-powerai/vision/).

The folder designated `opencv` runs applications purely within the OpenCV video window. The application can be stopped using `Q`, and the screen cleared and reset using `C`. 

The `flask` folder contains applications which have been wrapped within a simple Flask web application. Once you have your Python environment setup you can run them using the `python server.py` command. 

# Need to add...
- Javascript framework examples- using a purely client side driven approach. 
- Better documentation of the way the apps work- this can be inconjunction with a blog post.
